							<h2>Goals as a developer</h2>
						</header>

								<p>I think that everyone has a pretty similar goal in their life, and that is to be successful. That is my goal as a developer. Whichever path I pursue, whether it is front-end, back-end, or full-stack, that I am able to make an end product that is seamless, easy to use, and hopefully gives the user an enjoyable experience.</p>
                <p>I would like to work on a team where I truly believe in the product and I feel like I am making an impact. I previously worked in a retail store and I loved the people I worked with, but I didn’t necessarily feel like my impact at the end of the day was that meaningful.</p>
                <p>At this point, I find myself leaning towards front-end development. The reason why is that I am drawn to making a site user friendly and visually appealing. I feel that there are so many websites that are frustratingly hard to use, and I’m sure there are many factors that attribute to these issues that I haven’t learned about yet, but I know people would truly appreciate and go back to a site that is easy to navigate, loads quickly, and is simple to use.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned earlier, I want to work for a team and company that I believe in. I think every developer has their dream company. Some of mine include: Tesla, Uber, Lyft, Google, Apple, and Amazon. With Tesla, I see them as revolutionizing the way a car is built and trying to do whatever they can to find an alternative to fossil fuels. I think the auto-pilot feature in their cars is brilliant and they are changing the way cars are being driven. With ride-sharing companies like Uber and Lyft, they disrupted the whole taxi industry, and with Uber beginning to use self-driving cars in cities like Pittsburgh, I believe it is only a matter of time before we all see automated cars picking us up to go to work. Google has been notorious as a great company to work for, and I think the expansion from just being a search engine to being a multifaceted company speaks volumes about their vision and their teams. Apple changed the game with the release of the iPhone in 2007. I think that a company that has such high standards for their products is a company that I would want to work for. Lastly there is amazon. Since I worked in retail, I do feel that it would makes sense for me to join amazon. They have changed the way people shop and it is amazing to see what they’ll come up with next. I heard there are talks of a drone. All in all I’d be happy to work for any company that I believe in, but everyone does have their dream companies.</p>
